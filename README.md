This is Jack's history, a chubby lad who is keen on playing Blackjack. In other words, this is my Master's Final Project.

### 1st Sprint as of 10th march 2021:

1. Basic game logic: a multi-player blackjack game that only allows hitting and standing (game.py).

2. Interface: a ready-to-use terminal executable interface (bash_interface.py).

In progress:

I am delving into:
	
	- Markov Decision Processes
	- Dynamic programming
	- MC vs TD
	- Model Prediction
	- Model Control
